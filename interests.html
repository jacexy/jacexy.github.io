        <h2>Football</h2>
        <p>I've had an interest in the sport of football (soccer) for around a decade. I played at a low level from 2014-2018 for <a href="http://www.halifaxcitysoccerclub.ns.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halifax City Soccer Club</a>. After quitting playing club football at my local team, I began to watch my supported global club, <a href="https://fcbayern.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FC Bayern Munich</a>, more and more. Since then, I have played a bit of football with friends in gym classes and for YouTube videos, but I mainly watch the sport now instead of play.</p>

        <h2>FIFA (Video Game)</h2>
        <p>I have a love-hate relationship with the FIFA video game series, but I cannot get away from the game. I have played every title since FIFA 15 and it is by far my most played video game. It combines my love for football with my enjoyment of playing video games into one <small>(poorly made)</small> video game. I've always told myself that if I got into video game development, I would try to work at EA Sports in an attempt to make the FIFA video game series more playable and polished.</p>

        <h2>Video Creation</h2>
        <p>I have been creating videos on YouTube since 2013 when I began recording myself playing with LEGO. I then expanded into video games in 2015 when I created my new, and current channel. I started editing my videos in Windows Movie Maker, and then Sony Vegas. I uploaded over 500 videos to the "Jace" channel, though I deleted over 400 of them in recent years due to me only wanting to publish content that I genuinely enjoy. After 7 years, I have accumulated nearly 16 000 subscribers and over 8 million video views. As of today, I currently don't upload to my channel regularly, but my love for video creation still remains.</p>
